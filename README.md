# serverless-scripts

**NOW ARCHIVED**

Since this repo was last edited there have been a large number of tools created to help with AWS serverless services. E.g. from AWS alone there are SAM and CDK. I recommend you use one of those tools rather than the scripts here. If you want a "getting started" example using CDK see https://github.com/symphoniacloud/coffee-store-v2 .

Useful scripts for working with AWS Serverless Services

Serverless environments, like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and the like, are still fairly new. The tooling around them can occasionally feel a little bleeding edge. That said most of the lower level tooling, for AWS products at least, is thorough - it's the higher level abstractions that are finding their feet.

But since the low-level APIs and tools are good we can build on them with scripts. And that's what this repo is about. Nothing here should be considered a finished toolbox, but might well provide you with some ideas with which you can build your own tooling.

We start off with some 'zero to production' scripts. These bootstrap a 'walking skeleton', going from nothing to a deployed system, with template code that you can edit and extend as you wish.
